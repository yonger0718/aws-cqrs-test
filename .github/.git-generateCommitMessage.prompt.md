Commit messages must be written in Traditional Chinese and adhere to the Conventional Commits format. Each commit message should be detailed and comprehensive, thoroughly explaining the context and rationale behind the change.  It is essential to provide a complete understanding of the cause and effect of each modification, ensuring clarity for anyone reviewing the commit history.  The message should articulate the problem being addressed, the solution implemented, and the reasoning behind the chosen approach.  This level of detail is crucial for effective collaboration, code maintainability, and future debugging efforts.
Use bullet points to describe the changes.
If the commit is related to a work item, append the work item number, prefixed with '#' at the latest line of the message.

Depends on workitem, choice the correct commit type.
